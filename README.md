# php-data-visualisation
Initial code taken from PHP Architect December 2015

The purpose of the initial code was to run an R script to visualise a dataset.

The .csv file is the test data. The .php file runs the R script. The .R script analyses the data. The .html files show progress and the data visualisation. The .css and .js files make the visualisation and progress bar possible.

For some reason my development server doesn't like popen(), so I've yet to get this to work.
